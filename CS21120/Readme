This is the code for the CS21120 tournment app crucially I was required not to use any
java util other than:-
  *import java.util.ArrayList;
  *import java.util.Scanner;

The files in "bpt/cs21120/assignment1" make up the framework I was provided and needed to
provide the queue and priority queue from. 

The files in "rob41/cs21120/assignment1" implement the interface provided in IManager class
